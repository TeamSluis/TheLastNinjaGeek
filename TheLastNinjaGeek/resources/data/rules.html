	<h2>THE CODE OF THE NINJA GEEK</h2>
	
	<p>
		The NinjaGeek could be anyone as long as there is a strength to
		bite-on enough well the hook. The Player who doesn't want to lose may
		achieve it by not playing then will auto Mastering-UNLOOSER (lock with
		fingers). The looser has the right to complain 3 min unless the Sensei
		says it's OBSOLETE. When it's on great rush the player is allowed to
		scratch where there is no itch or to move from the chair without
		anybody forcing him. The game is played to the end, else-if
		(Sensei.Says) {this.Game = pointless; return;} However, sometimes the
		game may lasts if the loser is from a village. The good NinjaGeek has
		the strength to play on cold, rain, hunger, or even after the Sensei
		says BREAK. Playing game is like playing war - kill or you will be
		killed. So better fight wise or you will be fought and forgotten.
